### Questions

#### HTML - general:
1. naming - div vs. element naming (class name convention)(section..)

#### containers:
1. best way to size container?
2. why my 480px different than project's?


#### buttons:
1. buttons are made from html 'button' att. or from a div?
2. generic creation - no code repitition ? 
3. should use 'before' method to define buttons?
4. why/when use 'content'?
5. best way to center the text? better than padding? (align didnt work)
6. code minimization / readability? case of del/reset buttons? sim vs. diff
7. theme-chooser better way to center then padding . are % better px?


### JavaScript:
1. use of functions that call other function.


#### Notes
1. only for different styles define different html classes.


##### tal
1. specific targeting css
2. common styles - elements with similar appearances - can create a class to target the (e.g. 'all with border = none')
3. view - container for rows, not just logical diffrences.
4. precentage is better - responsive.
